## Implementation

Describe all the steps to use the Action:

- Fill in inputs
- What methods to use
- What are the resources?
- And if necessary, add other resources that depend on your Actions's type.

See an example:

In your application folder, run the **`action-doc-template`** to populate the files below:

1. Execute the command:

```
stk run action /Users/Home/action-doc-template
```

2. Fill in your Action information following the file template examples:

- `about.md`
- `implementation.md`
- `release-notes@action-version.md`
- `requirements.md`
